# Advanced-Snake-Game---Q-Learning
# README
This is the advanced snake game. We change some logic in this game. And the main thing I want to share is that we use the algorithm of Q Learning in this project

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- ï»¿Pygame
- Numpy

## Install requirements

```python
pip install requirements.txt
```

## Running the mode of training to get the agent file

```python
python Q_learning.py t
```

## Running the mode of showing to show the performance by the agent

```python
python Q_learning.py p
```

## Results

 The below picture is about the process of training
